# image-classification
This project is a basic and concise implementation of an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning technique. It showcases the ability of CNNs to analyze visual imagery by extracting features and patterns to categorize images into predefined classes effectively.
. It was developed as part of my learning process, where I studied and followed along with a tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/@NicholasRenotte
